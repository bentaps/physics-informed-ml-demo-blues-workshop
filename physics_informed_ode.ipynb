    "\n",
    "In classical engineering, we model dynamical systems through their governing differential equations. For a damped oscillator or pendulum, we know the physics: restoring forces scale with displacement, damping forces scale with velocity, and external forces produce accelerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we don't know all the physics? What if we have experimental data and we suspect the governing equations have an unknown form?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physics-Informed Machine Learning** combines two powerful ideas:\n",
    "1. **Physical knowledge** — encode known physics as constraints in our learning process\n",
    "2. **Machine learning** — let neural networks learn the unknown or complex parts we don't have models for\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates this approach on a dissipative pendulum system. We'll see how incorporating physical structure dramatically improves learning and parameter estimation compared to purely data-driven models."

    "   - Provides interpretable parameters ($K$, $C_0$ have physical meaning)\n",
    "   - Generalizes better to new trajectories\n",
    "   - Performs parameter estimation (inverse problem)\n",

    "**When to Use Physics-Informed Learning:**\n",
    "- You understand the *structure* of the physics but have unknown coefficients\n",
    "- You have limited training data\n",
    "- You need interpretable, verifiable parameters\n",
    "- The system should conserve or obey known constraints\n",
